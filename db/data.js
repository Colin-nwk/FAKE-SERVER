Add the porridge and soaked linseeds and work these into the dough mix – you want to give this a good 8 minutes. Use a scraper or your hands to get under the dough and lift it up, then lightly oil the inside of the bowl. Cover the bowl with a lid or a clean tea towel and leave it somewhere warm for 1 hour.

This just means grabbing the edge of the dough with a wet hand, stretching it up as high as it will go and folding it over on itself, working around the bowl as many times as the dough will let you – until it feels tight and as if it might tear. Over 4 hours, this means you’ll have given the dough 3 folds. With each fold, you should be starting to see more life in the dough. This process is what we call the bulk fermentation and it’s where the magic is happening.",

If it feels wet and sticky, give it another fold and leave it for a further 30 minutes. If it feels strong, just not that lively, leave out the extra fold but still give it more resting time. This is the fermentation period, and you can’t really rush it – just let it do its thing. You’ll get a feel for this sweet spot the more you bake. Put the dough in the fridge overnight. This will help develop the flavour, let it rest and get lovely and strong. (It can stay in the fridge for up to 24 hours.)",

With each quarter of dough, fold the points to the centre to make a very rough, long rectangle. You need to be gentle, but if you’re slow and too careful the dough will stick to your fingers and it’ll quickly get stressful. Flip the dough so the seams are facing down and the top is smooth, then let it rest for 30 minutes to come up to room temperature.",
      },

Grab the top edge and fold it into the middle of the dough, then grab the bottom edge and fold it over to meet the new top edge. Gently seal along this length with your thumbs. Roll the dough over so the seam is on the bottom. Next, cup both hands over the dough, your fingers resting on the work surface at the top and the heel of your hand on the surface at the bottom. Roll the dough, working your hands away from each other, so you’re lengthening the baguette Push your hands down harder as you reach the ends so you get that lovely pointed shape.

Take one strip and, starting from the short side, start rolling it back up again, keeping it tight and evenly coiled. Line the seam up with the edge of the second strip and continue to roll it up to make a large cylinder of cake. Repeat with the third strip. This method ensures there are lots of neat, evenly spaced lines of buttercream throughout the sponge.
